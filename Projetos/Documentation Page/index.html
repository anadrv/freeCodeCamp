            The ocean, covering more than 70% of the Earth, harbors an
            incredible diversity of marine creatures adapted to various
            environments, from vibrant coral reefs to dark abyssal depths. While
            clownfish, seahorses, and octopuses display beauty and intelligence
            in shallow waters, mysterious monsters like the dragonfish and the
            anglerfish demonstrate extraordinary adaptations to survive in
            darkness. Meanwhile, giants like whales and sharks roam the seas
            with majesty and efficiency.

            <h1>TURTLES</h1>
            <p>
              Sea turtles are remarkable marine creatures known for their
              resilience and long migrations across the oceans. With their
              strong, streamlined shells and powerful flippers, they navigate
              vast distances, often traveling thousands of miles between feeding
              grounds and nesting sites. Despite spending most of their lives in
              the open sea, female sea turtles always return to the very beaches
              where they were born to lay their eggs, guided by an extraordinary
              sense of direction. Unfortunately, these gentle reptiles face
              numerous threats, including habitat loss, pollution, and poaching,
              making conservation efforts critical for their survival. Sea
              turtles are not only symbols of endurance and grace but also vital
              contributors to the balance of marine ecosystems.

            <h1>SHARKS</h1>
            <p>
              Sharks are fascinating and often misunderstood predators that play
              a crucial role in maintaining the health of marine ecosystems.
              With their sleek bodies, keen senses, and powerful movements,
              sharks have adapted to a wide range of ocean environments, from
              shallow coastal waters to the deep sea. As apex predators, they
              help regulate the populations of other marine species, ensuring
              ecological balance. Despite their fearsome reputation, many shark
              species are slow to reproduce and are highly vulnerable to
              overfishing, bycatch, and habitat degradation. Conservation
              efforts are essential to protect these vital creatures,
              <strong>whose presence indicates a healthy ocean.</strong> Sharks
              are not only symbols of strength and evolution but also key allies
              in the preservation of marine biodiversity.

              Whales are majestic marine mammals known for their intelligence,
              social behavior, and immense size. These gentle giants roam the
              oceans in complex migratory patterns, often traveling thousands of
              miles between feeding and breeding areas. Whales communicate
              through a variety of sounds—some species even sing intricate songs
              that can travel vast distances underwater. As key players in
              marine ecosystems, whales help regulate food chains and contribute
              to the health of the ocean through nutrient cycling. Sadly, many
              whale species have faced serious threats from commercial whaling,
              ship strikes, noise pollution, and climate change. Protecting
              whales is not only essential for ocean health but also for
              preserving one of nature's most awe-inspiring creatures. Whales
              represent harmony, intelligence, and the interconnectedness of all
              life in the sea.
              <br><br>
              <p>Efforts to conserve whale populations include international agreements, marine protected areas, and advances in technology to reduce ship collisions and noise pollution. Public awareness and scientific research play crucial roles in ensuring these magnificent animals continue to thrive in their natural habitats for generations to come.</p>

            <p class="text">
              Fish are diverse aquatic animals that inhabit a wide range of
              freshwater and marine environments across the globe. With
              streamlined bodies, gills for breathing underwater, and fins for
              navigation. They
              play essential roles in aquatic food chains, acting both as
              predators and prey, maintaining the ecological balance of rivers,
              lakes, and oceans. Fish come in countless shapes, sizes, and
              colors — from tiny reef dwellers like gobies and clownfish to
              massive open-ocean species like tunas, marlins, and even the whale
              shark. Some species exhibit
              fascinating adaptations, such as bioluminescence, camouflage, or
              the ability to survive in extreme conditions. Beyond their
              ecological importance, fish are vital for the livelihoods and
              cultures of millions of people. Protecting fish means safeguarding not only
              individual species but also the intricate web of life. Fish symbolize adaptability, movement,
              resilience, and the hidden beauty of underwater life.

            <p class="text">
              Jellyfish are ancient, mesmerizing creatures that drift through the oceans with a graceful, pulsating motion. Despite their delicate, transparent appearance, many jellyfish possess stinging cells used for defense and capturing prey. They have existed for hundreds of millions of years, thriving without a brain, heart, or bones—an incredible feat of biological simplicity and efficiency. Jellyfish play important roles in ocean ecosystems but can also indicate changes in environmental health, such as warming waters and declining predator populations. These creatures remind us of nature's complexity and the importance of maintaining balance in marine habitats.

Their presence can sometimes affect human activities, as large swarms of jellyfish may disrupt fishing, clog cooling systems of power plants, and interfere with tourism. Understanding jellyfish behavior is crucial both marine and human life.
